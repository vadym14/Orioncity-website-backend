These groups came\n            together to advocate for cityhood. Through tireless determination,\n            the City of West Hollywood was officially incorporated as an\n            independent City on November 29, 1984.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The first West Hollywood City Council in 1984 established West\n            Hollywood as the first City in the nation to have a majority openly\n            gay governing body.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Located in the heart of metropolitan Los Angeles, at 1.9 square\n            miles, West Hollywood is a robust economic and cultural center\n            instilled with idealism and creativity.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            West Hollywood shares boundaries with the cities of Beverly Hills\n            and Los Angeles.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A spirit of community activism and civic pride thrives in West\n            Hollywood for many of its approximately 35,000 residents.
