These groups\n              came together to advocate for cityhood. Through tireless\n              determination, the City of West Hollywood was officially\n              incorporated as an independent City on November 29, 1984.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The first West Hollywood City Council in 1984 established West\n              Hollywood as the first City in the nation to have a majority\n              openly gay governing body.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Located in the heart of metropolitan Los Angeles, at 1.9 square\n              miles, West Hollywood is a robust economic and cultural center\n              instilled with idealism and creativity.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              West Hollywood shares boundaries with the cities of Beverly Hills\n              and Los Angeles.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              A spirit of community activism and civic pride thrives in West\n              Hollywood for many of its approximately 35,000 residents.
